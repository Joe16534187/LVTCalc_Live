# Repo for the test code of my LVT Calculator website

Repo for test LVT Map

## Webmap

Webmap showing land value across the North East of Scotland

## Process

Bulk of code has been generated using the qgis2web plugin for QGIS. I am then editing the code from there to (a) learn how to write code for the website, and (b) figure out the changes needed to have the functionality needed for the site
